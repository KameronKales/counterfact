The rest can become Github issues

- convert to TypeScript 
- name collisions between imports and exports
- import { exportName as localName }
- CLI
- convert to monorepo
- unit tests
- fix generated code so that it passes ESLint
- consistently import node:path as nodePath 
- refactor ugly stuff like `this.requirement.url.split("/").at(-1)`
- make sure it works if the spec is in multiple files
