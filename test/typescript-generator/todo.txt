Do these first
- refactor Coder / Script so Coder has a name() generator
- refactor Script#import() and Coder so that we don't have to pass the path in to import()
- refactor so that a script has a requirement and coder for each export, a coder does not have a requirement
- document the architecture

The rest can become Github issues

- name collisions between imports and exports
- import { exportName as localName }
- CLI
- convert to monorepo
- unit tests
- fix generated code so that it passes ESLint
